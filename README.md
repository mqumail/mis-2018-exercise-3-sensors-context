This is an app created by Alvarez Zendejas Luis Alberto (119446) and Muhammad Qumail (119432) for an assignment in Mobile Information Systems taught in the summer semester of 2018 at Bauhaus University Weimar, Germany

This app access your location to get the speed you are moving.

To determine the thresholds we have tested the app for each activity (walk, run, and bike).
We got the maximum value of the FFT graph while performing the activities with the app, and after a few tests we determine the following thresholds:

Walk 360 - 600

Run 600 - 900

Bike 360 - 500

Stand up 300 - 320
